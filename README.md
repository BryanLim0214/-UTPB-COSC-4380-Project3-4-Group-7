# UTPB-COSC-4380: Cryptography Projects 3 & 4

This repository contains the code and documentation for **Projects 3 and 4** of the *Cryptography* class, completed by **Group 7**:
- Alejandro Sotelo  
- Bryan Lim  
- Roman Huerta  

These projects focus on enhancing our understanding and implementation skills in **cryptography using Java**, specifically involving **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHE)**, **RSA**, and **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**.

## 🔐 Project 3: Diffie-Hellman and RSA Algorithms

### 🎯 Project Goals
- Improve Java/Python proficiency to solve cryptographic problems.
- Deepen understanding of **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHE)** and **RSA**.
- Provide practical implementations of key exchange and encryption/signature algorithms.

### 📄 Description
We implemented a cryptographic library using the provided Java/Python skeleton. Our work focused on:
- Completing the **Diffie-Hellman** and **RSA** methods marked with `TODO` comments.
- Writing JavaDoc comments for each method, specifying parameters and return values.
- Validating our implementations using provided unit tests.

### ⚙️ Key Features
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHE):** Supports both two-party and three-party exchanges.
- **RSA Algorithm:**
  - Encrypts and decrypts messages.
  - Generates and verifies digital signatures.

### ✅ Grading Compliance
- Fully functional and implements all required interfaces.
- Graceful exception handling to prevent crashes.
- Simple, well-documented, and user-friendly method design.

### 📦 Deliverables
- A Java/Python library that implements **DHE** and **RSA**.
- Clear documentation detailing:
  - The development process.
  - Resources and tools used.

## 🔒 Project 4: AES Algorithm (ECB and CBC Modes)

### 🎯 Project Goals
- Advance Java/Python skills for block cipher implementation.
- Develop a strong understanding of **AES** and its encryption modes.
- Deliver a practical AES encryption/decryption tool.

### 📄 Description
We implemented the **AES algorithm** in both **ECB** and **CBC** modes. Our methods:
- Accept plaintext, a key, and a mode indicator.
- Output the corresponding ciphertext or decrypted plaintext.

A **debug flag** is included to output the internal state after each encryption/decryption step for easy comparison against reference output.

### ⚙️ Key Features
- **AES in ECB and CBC modes** with debug output.
- **Encryption and Decryption** methods are modular and easy to use.

### ✅ Grading Compliance
- Successfully compiles and handles specified inputs.
- Adheres strictly to algorithmic steps and expected output.
- Clean, intuitive interface design.

### 📦 Deliverables
- Java/Python implementation of **AES** in ECB and CBC modes.
- Documentation outlining:
  - Development methodology.
  - References and educational resources.
